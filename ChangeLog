2005-06-24		Bryan Berg	<bryan@imeem.com>

	* generator/gen-out/WriteCS.cs
		- Don't output frameworks unless the output option is true

	* generator/generator.cs
		- Add -frameworkdir: parameter to allow specification of paths
		  to search for frameworks on the command line
	
	* generator/gen-out/Type.cs
		- Don't add typedefs for types that are actually void
		- Handle being able to parse "unsigned int[]" - treat it like a
		  pointer

	* generator/header-gen/Main.cs
		- Add a few new hardcoded typedefs
		- Remove two typedefs that we now generate enums for
		- Fix the comment parsing regexp
		- Don't use RemoveString() to get rid of comment blocks, it's
		  broken; use a regexp
		- Generate enums within @interface {} ... @end blocks instead
		  of ignoring them - because of this we generate several more
		  enums than usual
		- Don't generate noname enums

	* generator/macho-gen/MachOType.cs
		- Handle MachO file format changes between 10.3 and 10.4,
		  specifically - "type hinting"
		- Handle '#' type correctly in MachO files

	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSDatePickerCell.override
		- Override a method with both static and instance selectors; 
		  in C#, this isn't valid.

	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSObject.override
		- Override the name of the finalize selector's generated name,
		  both for the + and - selectors

	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSObjectController.override
	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSPersistentDocument.override
		- Override methods which the generator doesn't understand how
		  to handle yet; once/if we generate CoreData.framework, we'll
		  have the correct types for these.

	* generator/custom/Foundation/NSCalendarUnit.cs
	* generator/custom/Foundation/NSDateFormatterStyle.cs
	* generator/custom/Foundation/NSDateFormatterPadPosition.cs
	* generator/custom/Foundation/NSDateFormatterRoundingMode.cs
	* generator/custom/Foundation/NSNumberFormatterStyle.cs
	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSPointingDeviceType.cs
	* generator/custom/WebKit/NPNVariable.addin
	* generator/custom/WebKit/NPPVariable.addin
	* generator/custom/WebKit/WebDragDestinationAction.cs
	* generator/custom/WebKit/WebDragSourceAction.cs
		- Override newly generated enums which have external constants  

	* generator/mapping.xml
		- Updated for new generator output

2004-06-10	Urs C Muff	<umuff@quark.com>
	genstubs.pl
		- using '__' instead of '$_' for class names
		- using 'import' instead of 'include' for double include guard (makes NSString_stub.m compile)
		- don't output $class__alloc on NSObject, since NSObject already has a class method alloc

2004-06-10	Geoff Norton	<gnorton@customerdna.com>
	genstubs.pl:
		- changed return type of $class * back to id
		- removed Cocoa.h header
		- added $class.h header
		- added NSString.h header for NSLog error fix
		- added \n to all NSLog
		- fixed interface parsing
		- fixed tab / space consistency
		- fixed regex warning when methodType is undefined
		- cleaned output to be more descriptive

2004-06-09	C.J. Collier	<cjcollier@colliertech.org>

	* genstubs.pl (parseMethod):
	- noted why we are not supporting methods variable args
	- moved declaration of $methodName to where it is first used
	- updated $arg_rx to make argument name optional
	- reformatted Urs' $argType and $argName definition
	- changed the way the $methodName is assembled
	- changed the NSLog() call based on what type of method this is
