	* generator/custom/Foundation/ObjCMessaging.cs: Support objc_msgSend_stret set of calls.
	* generator/custom/AppKit/NSView.override: Fix the NSView.bounds call to send the right type.

	* BUGS: Drop me I'm ancient

	* Makefile.am: make distcheck happiness.

	* custom/Foundation/TypeConverter.cs: Walk up the className tree
	to find a known type instead of handling these on a case by case
	basis.
	* custom/Foundation/NSInvocation.override: Implement handling of 
	structures as method arguments.  Things like drawRect:NSRect will work
	now.

	* custom/Foundation/TypeConverter.cs: Handle more objc name munging
	* custom/AppKit/Application.cs: Create a NSAutoreleasePool for 
	mono 1.1.3 loaderless mode.

	* custom/Foundation/TypeConverter.cs: Handle NSColor name munging.
	* gen-out/Method.cs: Call getType on structs; not pass ValueType to 
	the invoker.
	* gen-out/Type.cs: Dont convert structs.

	* typeConversion.pl
	- Created.  Enter type mapping from ObjC to C#

	* genstubs.pl
	- Reading in typeConversion.pl and building a hash from it
	- Cleaned up unsupported function handling slightyl
	- Created a %cSharp hash that will eventually be populated by %objC.  This is what inspired typeConversion.pl

2004-12-06	Geoff Norton	<gnorton@customerdna.com>
	* genstubs.pl
	- BUGFIX: Fixed generation of protocols.
	- BUGFIX: Parse Foundation before AppKit to resolve most protocol dependancies
	- BUGFIX: Warn if a protocol is undefined.
	- BUGFIX: Dupe check protocol methods as well.
	- TODO: NSObject.h must be parsed before anything else

2004-12-06	C.J. Collier	<cjcollier@colliertech.org>

	* genstubs.pl (global)
	- Created global variables %imported, $appKitPath, $foundationPath
	- Got rid of $getProtocols
	- commented negation of autoflush operator ($|)
	- printing some satus messages

	
	* genstubs.pl (parseMethod)
	- added comment noting that we should only generate code within a delimiter
	- cleaned up the method parsing regex
	- added code to parse methods missing a return type
	- renamed $obj to $receiver
	- printing a message if there's a duplicate method
	- storing localtime in a variable
	- renamed $class to $name (class is misleading)
	- removed $skip stuff - replaced with commentsBeGone() :)

	* genstubs.pl (parseFile)
	- added code to traverse #import lines
	- not adding an alloc() function if it already exists

	* genstubs.pl (commentsBeGone)
	- Created
	
	
2004-06-15	C.J. Collier	<cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* genstubs.pl (parseMethod)
	- moved /* generated by */ comment to generation area
	- decoupled token gathering and stub file generation
	- Whining if we can't pare the method
	- not printing the method if it's an interface. duh :)

	* genstubs.pl (parseFile)
	- renamed FH -> $fh
	- crated a %common hash to contain persistent data
	- not parsing file if it doesn't match /^NS.*\.h/
	- processing @objC list after we finish with the entire file
	- created stub for creating C Sharp wrapper

2004-06-15	C.J. Collier	<cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* genstubs.pl (parseFile)
	- commented empty .cs file generator

2004-06-15	C.J. Collier	<cjcollier@colliertech.org>
	* genstubs.pl (parseMethod)
	- moved $methodName = split ... to the right location
